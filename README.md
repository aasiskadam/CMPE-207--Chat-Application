# CMPE-207--Chat-Application

Run the server and the client scripts in different terminals using 127.0.0.1 for HOST in your client. For group chat run the clent script in multiple terminals. The server script will log which IP addresses are accessing it, and after asking for the host address the client script will generate a GUI for the chat application.
